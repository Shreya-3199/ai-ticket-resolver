## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to enter a ticket title and description, so that I can get the category and suggested resolution.  
2. **As a support agent**, I want to see the ticket priority, so that I can handle critical issues first.  
3. **As a developer**, I want the system to provide web search recommendations, so users get additional resources.  
4. **As a project reviewer**, I want proper documentation, so I can understand the development process and features.

## Notes

- Agile approach followed with **iterative sprints** to ensure working features were delivered early.
